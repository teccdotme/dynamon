# dynamon
Dynamon is my attempt at a simple-to-use, cross-platform runtime linking for libraries.
It's written in ANSI C, because I wanted it to be as portable as possible.

## Libraries
Dynamon only uses one library, which is dlfcn-win32.

## Usage
Usage can be found in the Wiki, which I'm still making.

## License
Dynamon is licensed under the Apache License 2.0.
